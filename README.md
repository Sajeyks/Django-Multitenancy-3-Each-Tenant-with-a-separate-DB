# Each Tenant with a Separate DB(postgreSQL)
In implementing this third technique, we start with the basic Rocket company app that currently only supports one tenant and build on it, gradually making it multi-tenant. 
By the end, it is supposed to be able to use the same code base and separate databases to handle multiple tenants. We separate the tenantsâ€™ data by giving each of them their databases.
